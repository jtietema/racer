1. WELCOME
===========================================
Thanks for downloading RCr: Larry's Lawn. RCr is our entry for PyWeek #8, see
http://www.pyweek.org for more information.

If you find any bugs or have suggestions for the project, please report them at our 
issue tracker at the project website (http://bitbucket.org/jtietema/racer/).

2. REQUIREMENTS / INSTALLING
===========================================
As of now, there is no installer for RCr available, so you will need to install
all dependencies yourself. Fortunately, most of the you (that is, the other
contestants) will already have most libraries installed.

This is the list of requirements for this version:

- Python 2.5+
- pyglet 1.1.3
- cocos2d 0.3.0
- PIL

All dependencies except Python itself (of course) are available through
easy_install.

The game can be started by running: "python main.py" from the root directory of the game.
